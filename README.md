# Day to Day

This repo will serve as a central place to document the day to day at BCCA.

The intended use is that each day will have a `day#<number>.md` file where
we document our expected work and then update to reflect the actual work.
Hopefully, this gives us a good tool to document and reflect on the year.

At the end of the year, we can tag `git tag v<YYYY>` to maintain checkpoints
between years.
