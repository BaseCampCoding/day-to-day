# First Week

**Students should be able to predict program behavior.**

- What line will the program go to next?
- What are the current variable/value bindings in the current scopes?

**Students should be able to construct small programs with covered constructs.**

## Notes

### No book (for at least the first week)

I think:

- Consuming the book is an indepedent skillset.
- We have seen a fair portion of the class struggle to consume the book.
- I originally suggested this book as a tradeoff for not developing curriculum
  from scratch.
- We have the ability to deviate from the book for the sake of reducing dependence
  on student's reading ability.
- The book can serve as a reference curriculum to make sure we don't forget anything.
- Reading time can be replaced with higher yield lecture/call-and-response time.
- This will lead to meaningful gains for students.

### PythonTutor then Python

Moral of the story: slow-motion then full-speed.

1. MTW: All PythonTutor
2. Thursday: PythonTutor -> Python
3. Friday: Python

- PythonTutor enables fine grained exercise/assessment for predicting program behavior.
- I (will) have installed it on the class computers (for internet outages' sake).

## Daily Schedule

**Goal:** Under the goal of program prediction, each day has a set of programs
that students should be able to predict step-by-step by the end of the day.
Then, they should be able to construct target programs using the new constructs
in a prescribed way.

**Assessment:** Students should be able to predict program behavior of a set of
target code samples.
